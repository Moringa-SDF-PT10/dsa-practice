# ðŸ§  Python Data Structures & Algorithms â€” Notebooks Collection

Welcome to this hands-on **Jupyter Notebook** repository for learning and practicing **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** in Python. This series is designed for intermediate learners and is ideal for students, bootcamp attendees, and professionals looking to strengthen their DSA fundamentals.

## ðŸ“˜ Notebook Topics

Each notebook focuses on a core concept in data structures and algorithm analysis, with detailed explanations, code examples, and visualizations.

### ðŸ”¢ Complexity Analysis

## ðŸ’» How to Use

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:Moringa-SDF-PT10/dsa-practice.git
   cd dsa-practice
   ```


2. **Install dependencies using Pipenv**:

   ```bash
   pipenv install
   pipenv shell
   ```

3. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```


## ðŸ“¦ Dependencies

Dependencies are managed via `Pipenv` and include:

* `matplotlib`
* `numpy` (optional for performance-based demos)

To add more:

```bash
pipenv install <package-name>
```
